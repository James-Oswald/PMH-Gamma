Interactive theorem provers offer users a means of formalizing and proving logical and mathematical statements. Traditional interactive theorem provers, such as Hyperslate, Lazyslate, Athena, Lean, and others offer users the ability to prove theorems in a proof system called natural deduction which models how humans reason about finding proofs in natural language. Other proof systems such as axiom based Hilbert systems are smaller with a tradeoff that proofs are harder to find. One interesting proof system is Charles Sanders Peirceâ€™s Existential Graph visual proof system, in which formulae are represented as 2d drawings, inference rules are transformations of these drawings, and proofs are linear (non-branching) sequences of transformations.
